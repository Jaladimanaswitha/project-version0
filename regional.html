        <h1> Regional cuisine </h1>
        <p>Cuisine differs across India's diverse regions as a result of variation in local culture, geographical location 
            (proximity to sea, desert, or mountains), and economics. It also varies seasonally, depending on which fruits 
            and vegetables are ripe.

            <h2>Northern indian food</h2>
            <p>
                Perhaps the most prevalent culinary style found outside of India, Northern Indian cuisine reflects a strong Mughal influence. It is characterized
                 by a high use of dairy: milk, paneer (an Indian mild cheese), ghee (clarified butter), and yogurt are all used regularly in Northern dishes.
                  Samosas, fried pastries stuffed with potatoes and occasionally meat, are a distinctive Northern snack. Clay ovens known as tandoors are popular
                 in the North, giving dishes like Tandoori Chicken and Naan bread their distinctive charcoal flavor. A significant number of Northern dishes make
                 regular appearances on Indian menus. Dal or Paneer Makhani are popular vegetarian dishes, consisting of dal or paneer cooked in a creamy sauce of 
                tomatoes, onions, mango powder, and garam masala. Saag Paneer and Palak Paneer are two similar dishes made with spinach, cream, and paneer,
                 differing slightly in consistency and spices. Korma, another menu staple from Northern India, is a creamy curry of coconut milk or yogurt,
                cumin, coriander, and small amounts of cashews or almonds. It can be served with different meats, usually chicken or lamb, but sometimes beef,
                 as well as with paneer for a vegetarian dish.
