        <h1>Eastern Indian Cuisine </h1>
        <p>
            East India is comprised of the states of West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, 
            Mizoram, Tripura, and Orissa. This region is home to beaches and mountains and Cherrapunji, the city with the highest 
            rainfall in the world.Because of the climate, Eastern India grows a lot of rice! Green vegetables and fruit are also 
            abundant and thus are the recipes using them. People, though, are a balanced mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian. 
            The geographical location of this region means its food bears the strong influence of Chinese and Mongolian cuisine. 
            Eastern Indian cuisine is primarily known for its desserts. These desserts are not only favored by other regions in
            India, but are frequently found at Indian restaurants, their light sweetness making an excellent finale to a meal.
            Rasgulla is a popular sweet treat consisting of semolina and cheese curd (chenna) balls that are boiled in a light
            sugar syrup. Eastern dishes favor mustard seeds, poppy seeds, and mustard oil, giving dishes a light pungency.
            Rice and fish also feature prominently in Eastern cuisine. Overall, Eastern dishes are more lightly spiced than 
            those from other regions.

             cuisine in almost every city you visit. One popular dish is the doi machh, which is Bengali fish curry with rice.
              Other well-known delicacies include the sandesh, daab jhingri (a special mustard prawn curry), rasgulla and mishti doi.

            If you haven't had sandesh yet, you should definitely try it out this Durga Puja

        <p>
            Bihari cuisine is eaten mainly in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, as well as in the places where people
            originating from the state of Bihar have settled: Jharkhand, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mauritius, 
            South Africa, Fiji, some cities of Pakistan, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Jamaica, and the Caribbean.
            Bihari cuisine includes Bhojpuri cuisine, Maithil cuisine and Magahi cuisine.

            People don’t know enough about the typical cuisine of Bihar even though it is excessively rich in taste and
            austere in the way it is prepared. The most admired delicacy of the state is litti and chokha, which consists 
            of roasted wheat balls stuffed with a special filling and mashed potatoes with distinct flavors. Also worth trying
            are the sattu parathas, jhal murhi, khaja and tilkut.
            Bihar is equally famous for its luscious non-vegetarian delights. Patna’s famous Mutton Kebabs have an equally
            rich and historical origin. The aroma from a small shop in Kadamkua attracts you like a magnet and introduces you 
            to Mahgu; His Great Grandfather was a chef in the British court. Mahgu’s Mutton Kebab’s are a delightful miracle to
            your taste buds.

            Odia Cuisine is the cuisine of the state of Odisha. It has developed over time with local culture and agriculture
             and hence has its distinct items and practices. Odisha borders both north Indian states and south Indian states and 
             consequently is similar to the cuisines of South and North India. Compared to other regional Indian cuisines, 
             Odia cuisine uses less oil and is less spicy while nonetheless remaining flavourful.Rice is the staple food of this 
             region. Mustard oil is used in some dishes as the cooking medium, but ghee (made of cow's milk) is preferred in temples.
             In old times food was traditionally served on banana leaves or disposable plates made of sal leaves.

            the summer heat. Made from soaking cooked rice in sour curd and water, this dish from Odisha is served with fried 
            fish, potatoes, Badi choora, and papad on the side. Being a popular food and main food of Odisha, this delicacy 
            should be one of your first dishes to try on your trip to Odisha.
