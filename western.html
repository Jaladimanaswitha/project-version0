        <h1>Western Indian Cuisine </h1>

            Western Indian cuisine is distinguished by the geographic and historical particulars of its three main regions: 
            Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Goa. Maharashtra’s coastal location is responsible for its fish and coconut milk-dominant 
            cuisine. Gujarati cuisine is mostly vegetarian and has an underlying sweetness to many of its dishes due to Chinese
             influence. Since the dry climate of this region produces smaller vegetables, this region is well known for its chutneys, 
             which are popular Indian condiments that use cooked, fresh, or pickled vegetables and fruits with sweet, sour, or 
             spicy flavors. Goa acted as a major trade port and colony for Portugal, resulting in a distinctive and unique blend 
             of Indian and Portuguese culinary elements. Goan cuisine uses pork and beef with greater frequency than other regional
            cuisines in India. Vinegar is also a characteristic ingredient of Goan cuisine, another result of Portuguese influence. 
            The prevalence of coconut milk, coconut paste, and fish in Goan cuisine results from its coastal location. Vindaloo is 
            a traditional Goan dish that is an Indian restaurant mainstay, its name deriving from Vinho de Alho, a Portuguese 
            marinade consisting primarily of garlic, wine, vinegar, and chilies.

            while sharing much with other Indian cuisines. Traditionally, Maharashtrians have considered their food to be more austere 
            than others.Maharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes. Wheat, rice, jowar, bajri, vegetables, lentils 
            and fruit are dietary staples. Peanuts and cashews are often served with vegetables. Meat was traditionally used sparsely
             or only by the well off until recently, because of economic conditions and culture.

            you can find amazing restaurants serving typical local food. The most cherished is the<strong> vada pav </strong>, which is a potato
            fritter stuffed between bread buns, served with piquant chutney and green chilies. Other prominent dishes from this
            region include, pav-bhaji, shrikhand, thalipeeth, puran poli and modak.<br>

            Loosely translated as leaf dumpling, <strong> patrode</strong> is a savory vegetarian dish from Malvani and Maharashtrian cuisine. 
            Basic ingredients are the same throughout the entire region—colocasia leaves stuffed (or chopped up) with a mixture
             of gram flour, rice flour, tamarind, jaggery, and various spices, while patrode variations differ only in shape 
             (sliced rolls or dumplings) and the cooking method (steamed or fried).
