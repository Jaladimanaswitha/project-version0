            <strong>Puttu and Kadala Curry</strong>

            A widely favoured combination, Puttu and Kadala curry is a common vegetarian breakfast savoured in homes and restaurants
             alike, across Kerala. Puttu is made of rice powder mixed with coconut and water, which is then steamed in cylindrical 
             steel or coconut shaped mould. Kadala curry is a mildly spicy curry of black chickpeas cooked in thick, aromatic 
             coconut gravy. The combo is easy to cook and therefore forms a go-to recipe for a quick and healthy breakfast.
             Yet another delicacy made of rice powder, these hoppers are a favoured component of meals that can be enjoyed any 
             time – breakfast, lunch, or dinner.<br> 
            <strong> Appam </strong> can be combined with vegetarian gravies such as stew, and can also be a
            classic sidekick for non-vegetarian fare such as chicken curry, mutton, and Kerala’s favourite, beef. Best when 
           devoured fresh, appam can lose its taste as it cools down.
